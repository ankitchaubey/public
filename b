If you clone the git source, you’ll find a sub-directory called contrib.
It contains a bunch of git-related tools and other interesting bits and
pieces that haven’t yet been promoted to git core. One of these is a Perl
script called diff-highlight. Diff-highlight pairs up matching lines of 
diff output and highlights sub-word fragments that have changed.
